    | **Acknowledgements**: 
    | This approach evolved over time and through several research projects.
    | I would like to thank all those who have directly or indirectly, consciously or unconsciously, inspired me to take a closer look at this approach and who have given me the opportunity to apply this approach in various contexts. In particular, I would like to thank:
    | Julia Offermann, for indispensable discussions about this approach and so much encouragement and constructive comments during the last meters of the manuscript.
    | Ralf Philipsen, without whom the very first study with that approach would never have happened, as we developed the crazy idea to explore the benefits of barriers of using "side-by-side" questions in Limesurvey.
    | Martina Ziefle for igniting scientific curiosity and motivating me to embark on a journey of boundless creativity and exploration.
    | Felix Glawe, Luca Liehner, and Luisa Vervier for working on a study that took this concept to another level.
    | Julian Hildebrandt for in-depth discussions on the approach and for validating the accompanying code.
    | Tim Schmeckel for feedback on the draft of this article.
    | Throughout the process I received feedback from reviewers that helped to question this approach and improve the foundation of this approach.
    | No scientific method of the social sciences alone will fully answer all of our questions.
    | We hope that this method provides a fresh perspective on exciting and relevant questions.
