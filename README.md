This repository accompanies a methodological article and provides R/Quarto notebooks for the analysis of micro scenario based studies.The rendered documentation and examples can be found here:[https://braunerphilipp.github.io/MappingAcceptance/](https://braunerphilipp.github.io/MappingAcceptance/)As technology evolves rapidly, understanding public perception becomes increasingly crucial.This article/page introduces an integrative method for evaluating mental models and social acceptance of various technologies. Our approach utilizes micro scenarios coupled with visual-spatial mapping, offering a comprehensive perspective that contrasts with traditional methods focused on detailed assessments of limited scenarios. This methodology allows for simultaneous evaluation of multiple technologies on visio-spatial maps, facilitating a comparative ranking based on diverse criteria and an exploration of the interplay between individual factors and technology attributes in shaping public opinion. Our approach provides a framework for researchers and policymakers to gauge critical issues and to identify factors pivotal to acceptance. We illustrate this methodology with examples from our research, offering practical guidelines and R code to enable others in conducting similar studies. This paper aims to bridge the gap between technological advancement and societal perception, offering a tool for more informed decision-making in the realm of technology development and policy.
